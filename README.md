# Halloween Fun Page

This project is a fun and interactive webpage for Halloween. It features a moving spider animation, an interactive switch to trigger the animation, and some interesting Halloween facts.

## Features

- **Spider Animation**: A spider descends from the top of the page when the switch is activated and moves left to right once the animation finishes.
- **Halloween Switch**: A toggle switch labeled "Find the Spider" activates the spider's fall animation.
- **Fun Facts**: After the switch, there is a section displaying some interesting facts about Halloween.
- **Sound Effect**: Clicking the spider plays a spooky sound.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS (animations, positioning, and design)
- JavaScript (for handling user interactions and triggering animations)
  
## How It Works

1. **Spider Animation**: 
   - When the user checks the switch, the spider starts descending from the top.
   - After the spider reaches its destination, it will start moving left to right indefinitely.
   
2. **Sound Effect**: 
   - The spider plays a sound effect when clicked.
   
3. **Interactive Switch**: 
   - Toggling the switch activates the spider's movement and the background change.
   
4. **Halloween Fun Facts**: 
   - A small section below the switch shares some interesting Halloween trivia to engage users.
