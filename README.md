# Halloween Fun Page

 This project is a simple yet entertaining web application designed to bring some fun with an interactive Halloween theme. Users can discover spooky facts, find the hidden spider, and enjoy some cool animations and sound effects!

## Features

- **Halloween Switch**: Toggle a spooky background animation and make a spider appear with a simple switch.
- **Find the Spider**: Click on the spider to trigger a scary sound effect.
- **Fun Facts**:  Display interesting facts about Halloween when the page loads.


## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS (animations, positioning, and design)
- JavaScript (for handling user interactions and triggering animations)
  
## How It Works

1. **Spooky Background and Spider Animation**: 
   - When the switch is toggled, the background changes to a spooky Halloween theme, and the spider animates downward on the screen.
      
2. **Sound Effect**: 
   - The spider plays a sound effect when clicked.
   
3. **Halloween Fun Facts**: 
   - A small section below the switch shares some interesting Halloween trivia to engage users.
